abstract: This study uses an experimental audit design, implemented both before and
  during the heightened unrest following the murder of George Floyd, to gauge the
  impact of Black Lives Matter and associated protests against police brutality and
  anti-Black racism on racially disparate hiring practices. We contrast treatment
  of fictitious Black and White job applicants in the labor market for service-related
  job openings, specifically applicants with prior experience as a police officer,
  firefighter, or code enforcement officer. Results reveal that the White advantage
  in employer call-backs and requests for an interview receded during the protests
  and unrest following the killing of George Floyd, even to the point of producing
  a Black advantage.
