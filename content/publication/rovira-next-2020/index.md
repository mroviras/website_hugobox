abstract: The use of criminal background checks (CBCs) – requests for information
  on previous convictions during the employment recruitment process – is growing worldwide.
  This article seeks to explain the proliferation in CBCs by examining whether novel
  legislation introducing mandatory requests for some jobs also leads to an increase
  in requests for CBCs for jobs outside the scope of the law. The present research
  makes use of survey data collected from individuals requesting criminal records
  certificates before and after the introduction of new CBC regulation in Spain –
  EU Directive 93/2011/EU – which established the obligation to request a criminal
  record certificate covering sexual crimes for jobs involving frequent contact with
  children. The analysis detects only a small and unsustained growth in non-mandatory
  checks following introduction of the new law. However, the results suggest that
  the danger of the new legislation lies in employers requesting certificates with
  a higher level of disclosure than is required for the positions on which checks
  were made mandatory by the new law. In addition, the growth in non-mandatory CBCs
  observed during this period seems to be related not to the new legislation but to
  the emergence of tech companies, raising alarm regarding the role of novel forms
  of policy mobility and the new collaborative economy in limiting the re-entry of
  individuals with criminal records to the labour market.
