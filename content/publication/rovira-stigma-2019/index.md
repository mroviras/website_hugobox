abstract: The aim of this research is to determine whether the stigma of a criminal
  record should be considered in understanding the precarious conditions of individuals
  with convictions in the Spanish labour market. Previous studies have been unable
  to separate this effect from other explanations such as low levels of education
  or the breakdown of networks resulting from the conviction. Following Pager (2007),
  this study adopts the experimental methodology of the audit tests, in which matched
  fictitious curricula vitae, differing only in the mention of a conviction, are sent
  to real job offers, to verify whether there is a difference in the number of responses
  to each CV. The results show that skilled former offenders are discriminated in
  the Spanish labour market as a result of the stigma of a criminal record.
