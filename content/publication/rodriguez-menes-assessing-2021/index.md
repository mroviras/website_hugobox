abstract: textlessptextgreaterCorrespondence studies are popular tools for assessing
  discrimination against minorities, for example, in the labor market. Typically,
  two fake Curriculum Vitae (CVs) are sent to multiple job openings. The CVs are equivalent
  except for a mark identifying the disadvantaged. While it is straightforward to
  establish discrimination from minorities’ lower response rates, it is often unclear
  what its source may be. Discrimination may result as much from employers’ aversion
  toward a minority, as from perceptions that members have lower or more dispersed
  abilities that are unstandardizable in a CV. We refine existing methodologies to
  propose a wider-scope method capable of disentangling these three sources of discrimination
  and establish its face validity applying it to a correspondence study aimed at assessing
  labor market discrimination against ex-convicts in a local market.textless/ptextgreater
