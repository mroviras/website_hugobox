abstract: In this article, we highlight the existence and expansion of so-called ‘collateral
  consequences’ (CCs) of criminal records in Europe to challenge the prevalent view
  that these are features of the claimed ‘American exceptionalism’ within the penal
  field. First, we consider how CCs have been widely presented as a quintessential
  example of American penal exceptionalism within extant scholarship before problematising
  the adoption of such a framework from a European perspective. Second, we demystify
  the issue of CCs within Europe by highlighting the deleterious effects which CCs
  have on the lives of European people with a criminal record. Third, we consider
  precisely what can be regarded as ‘exceptional’ about CCs in the United States as
  compared to Europe by analysing key areas of possible differentiation. We conclude
  by cautioning against the view that European penality is necessarily – and always
  homogeneously and consistently – ‘progressive’ in relation to its treatment of criminal
  records and criminal record subjects. We also suggest that far greater attention
  and vigilance is required from criminologists and criminal justice scholars regarding
  the expansion and operation of CCs in Europe.
