abstract: Abstract The extensive use of criminal background checks—the request for
  information on prior convictions for non-judicial purposes—creates obstacles to
  a fair reentry of individuals with criminal records. Previous research has documented
  the growth in the use of criminal background checks in Western jurisdictions. However,
  much less is known about the evolution of criminal background checks in other parts
  of the world. In this study, I present and analyse an original dataset with information
  on requests for official criminal record certificates for non-judicial purposes
  in 52 countries. The results show that the reported use of criminal background checks
  for non-judicial purposes is rising in nearly every country measured. These findings
  advance our knowledge about the international character of a previously-ignored
  dimension of the globalisation of punitiveness.
