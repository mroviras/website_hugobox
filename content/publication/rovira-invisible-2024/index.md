abstract: Abstract Labour market discrimination against individuals with criminal
  records may be unfair, ineffective and counterproductive. This article describes
  a field experiment designed to indicate whether job applicants disclosing a criminal
  record in the British labour market have a lower probability of success than equivalent
  applicants not disclosing criminal records. The research also provides insights
  into the potential effects of introducing a Ban-The-Box (BTB) policy in the United
  Kingdom, which would prohibit questions on prior convictions in the first stages
  of the recruitment process. The results confirm the existence of criminal record
  discrimination and suggest that introducing a BTB policy would increase job prospects
  for White applicants with criminal records, but not for members of ethnic minorities.
