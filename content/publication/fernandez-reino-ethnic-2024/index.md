abstract: Abstract Ethnic minority job-seekers may have incentives to include or omit
  photographs from résumés depending on the social norms regarding this practice and
  the extent to which their outward appearances diverge from the majority group. To
  investigate minorities’ incentives to engage in a specific type of résumé whitening––omitting
  photographs to avoid discrimination based on phenotypical traits or religious attire––we
  draw on data from an audit field experiment conducted between 2016 and 2018 in the
  Netherlands and Germany. Our analysis highlights the challenges for anticipating
  discrimination (and, thus, deciding to engage in résumé whitening) since it is difficult
  to predict employers’ true preferences with respect to the inclusion of photographs.
  In the Netherlands, unveiled Turkish women were better off submitting their picture
  rather than omitting it, but the premium associated with the inclusion of photographs
  disappeared if they wore the Muslim headscarf. For unveiled Moroccan women, there
  was no discernible advantage or disadvantage associated with the inclusion of pictures
  in job applications. In contrast, in the German context, minority women with high
  prototypical appearance (brown phenotype or wearing the Muslim headscarf) would
  have incentives to omit their photographs from job applications, particularly if
  they wore the Muslim headscarf. For Moroccan and Turkish men in the two countries,
  the inclusion of pictures with different phenotypes does not affect employers’ responses.
  To conclude, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of blind recruitment policies
  (i.e. omitting all ethnic identifying cues from résumés, including photographs and
  names) in the European context.
