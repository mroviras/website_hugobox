abstract: 'This article aims at analysing the differences between European countries
  in the obstacles ex-offenders face due to having a criminal record. First, a comparative
  analytical framework is introduced that takes into account all the different elements
  that can lead to exclusion from the labour market by the dissemination of criminal
  record information. This model brings together social norms (macro level), social
  actors (meso level) and individual choices (micro level) in the same framework.
  Secondly, this model is used to compare the different impact of having a criminal
  record in Spain and the Netherlands. This comparison highlights three important
  findings: (1) the difference between norms of transparency/privacy and inclusive/exclusive
  ideals, (2) the significant role of social control agents, such as probation agencies
  and the ex-offendersâ€™ social network, in shaping the opportunities that they have,
  and (3) self-exclusion seems to be a key mechanism for understanding unsuccessful
  re-entry into the labour market.'
