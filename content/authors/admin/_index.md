      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain) and member of the SocioDemographics Research Group DemoSoc Group. Previously I was a British Academy Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford’s Sociology Department and a Non-stipendiary Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Nuffield College.

My work to date has explored questions about the intersections between social inequalities and the criminal justice system, with a strong focus on the effects of Criminal Background Checks (CBCs) –requests for information on previous convictions for non-judicial purposes-.

In my past research, I have mainly relied upon quantitative methods, including experimental audit designs. Notwithstanding, my work is methodologically plural, and I always strive to keep up to date with methodological developments in criminology, sociology and beyond. In recent years in my work I have relied on computational social science methods
